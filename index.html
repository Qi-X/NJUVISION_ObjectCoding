        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>The Object-Based Image Coding (OBIC) that was extensively studied about two decades ago, promised a vast application perspective for both ultra-low bitrate communication and high-level semantical content understanding, but it had rarely been used due to the inefficient compact representation of object with arbitrary shape. A fundamental issue behind is how to efficiently process the arbitrary-shaped objects at a fine granularity (e.g., feature element or pixel wise). To attack this, we have proposed to apply the element-wise masking and compression by devising an object segmentation network for image layer decomposition, and parallel convolution-based neural image compression networks to process masked foreground objects and background scene separately. All components are optimized in an end-to-end learning framework to intelligently weigh their (e.g., object and background) contributions for visually pleasant reconstruction. We have conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance on PASCAL VOC dataset at a very low bitrate scenario (e.g., â‰²0.1 bits per pixel - bpp) which have demonstrated noticeable subjective quality improvement compared with JPEG2K, HEVC-based BPG and another learned image compression method.</p>

        <p><strong>Fig.1. LearntOBIC.</strong> A two-layer structure is exemplified with upper part for object and lower part for background. Image segmentation uses the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00915">DeepLab</a> with ResNet-34 as backbone, while a variational autoencoder (VAE) based <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06244">NLAIC</a> is used to process masked image layers in parallel. Q is for quantization, AE and AD are for respective arithmetic encoding and decoding.</p>
